# Luz

**Luz** is a C++20 Path Tracer developed from scratch with zero third-party dependencies.

It supports Monte Carlo path tracing, global illumination, BVH acceleration,
adaptive sampling, denoising, atmospheric scattering, physically parameterized
scene files, and a Blender-to-Luz exporter.

## Requirements

- C++20 compiler
- Make or CMake 3.16+
- Python 3, only for optional tools/scripts

## Quick Start

Build with the Makefile:

```sh
make
```

Render a bundled example scene:

```sh
./luz examples/scenes/cornell.luz --samples 50 --resolution 300x300
```

The primary output is `render.bmp`, with `render_denoised.bmp` written by
default. Scene files can set `outputfilename=...`, and the CLI can override
common render settings. Use a `.bmp`, `.png`, or `.tiff` output path to select
the format.

The volumetric fog and godrays sample is:

```sh
./luz --file examples/scenes/volumetric_godrays.luz --threads 8
```

Run the test suite:

```sh
make test
```

## Benchmarking

Luz includes deterministic benchmarks for render, denoise, post-process, and
overall score comparisons.

```bash
make benchmark BENCH_CPUS=1 BENCH_THREADS=1 > before.csv
make benchmark BENCH_CPUS=1 BENCH_THREADS=1 > after.csv
make benchmark-compare BEFORE=before.csv AFTER=after.csv
```

For details, see [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).

## CMake

A CMake build is also available:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

## Platform Support

Supported platforms:

- macOS
- Linux
- Windows

On macOS and Linux, the Makefile is the primary path. On Windows, use CMake with
MSVC or the MinGW-based Makefile target:

```sh
make windows
```

WSL is also supported as a Linux build environment.

## Build Optimizations

Release builds are tuned for the machine doing the build by default. The
Makefile enables `-O3`, native CPU tuning with `-march=native`, and link-time
optimization with `-flto`. It also enables a fast floating-point mode where the
compiler/platform supports it. CMake uses the same release intent: `-O3`, native
CPU tuning, and interprocedural optimization/LTO when supported.

These defaults produce faster local renders, but binaries built with
`-march=native` may not run on older or different CPUs, and LTO can expose
toolchain-specific linker issues. If you hit an illegal-instruction crash,
linker error, or need a more portable binary, disable the aggressive options and
rebuild from clean objects:

```sh
make clean
make NATIVE=0 LTO=0
```

For CMake builds, configure with the optimization toggles off:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DLUZ_NATIVE_OPTIMIZATIONS=OFF -DLUZ_ENABLE_LTO=OFF
cmake --build build --clean-first
```

```

TIFF output stores RGB as uncompressed 32-bit IEEE floating-point samples. Use
`--output render.tiff --view-transform raw` to preserve scene-linear ACEScg HDR
values above 1.0. Raw output is for debugging, measurement, and compositing data,
not normal viewing.

## Physically Based Authoring

Luz scene units are controlled with `meters_per_unit`, and color values are
converted into scene-linear ACEScg before rendering. Numeric triples are ACEScg
values by default; use explicit functions for other sources:

```text
color=srgb(0.8,0.2,0.1)
color=wavelength(550nm)
color=blackbody(3000K)
color=solar
color=reflectance(materials/red_paint.spd)
```

Lights can be authored with physical quantities:

```text
area_light softbox {
position=(0,3,0)
size=(2,1)
normal=(0,-1,0)
color=blackbody(3200K)
lumens=12000
}

directional_light sun {
direction=(-0.2,-1,-0.1)
color=solar
solar=1
}
```

Cameras can use real lens controls:

```text
camera main {
position=(0,1.5,5)
direction=(0,0,-1)
focal_length_mm=50
sensor_width_mm=36
sensor_height_mm=24
f_stop=2.8
focus_distance=4
shutter=0.0166667
iso=400
}
```

The complete scene-file reference is in
[`docs/scene-files.md`](docs/scene-files.md).

## Adaptive Sampling

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default. `--samples` is the maximum samples per
pixel when adaptive stopping is active. Each pixel uses a progressive per-pixel
sample sequence, renders at least
`--adaptive-min-samples`, then periodically checks luminance and RGB confidence
intervals. Very dark pixels use a conservative minimum before they can stop, so
rare light contributions are less likely to be mistaken for converged black.
Use `--no-adaptive` or `--adaptive false` to render every pixel for the full
sample count.

Lower thresholds keep more detail and cost more time. For final renders, start
with a high max sample count and tune with values like:

```sh
./luz exports/stormtroopers.luz --samples 4096 --adaptive-min-samples 512 --adaptive-check-interval 64 --adaptive-threshold 0.005
```

## Denoising

Denoising is enabled by default. Luz's NFOR-style feature-buffer denoiser writes
a separate companion image: by default, `render.bmp` becomes
`render_denoised.bmp`; use `--denoise-output PATH.EXT` to choose the exact
path. Use `--no-denoise` or `--denoise false` to skip the companion render.

PNG output writes post-processed 8-bit RGB SDR images using stored DEFLATE
blocks for dependency-free writing.

The denoiser has no hard minimum resolution or sample count, but it needs enough
signal to estimate useful color and feature statistics. One sample per pixel is
mainly a stress test: there is no per-pixel variance estimate, so the denoised
image can look almost unchanged or can smooth the wrong details. Use at least a
few samples per pixel for previews, and prefer roughly 16+ samples per pixel
when judging denoiser quality. Very low resolutions also make evaluation
misleading because each local filter window covers too much of the image.

## Scene Files

Example scenes live in `examples/scenes/`. The scene-file format is documented in [`docs/scene-files.md`](docs/scene-files.md).

Object paths in `.luz` files use the path provided by the scene: absolute paths are used as-is, and relative paths are resolved from the directory containing the `.luz` file. Keep large or generated OBJ assets local unless they are intentionally reviewed for inclusion.

OBJ meshes can be declared, transformed, and assigned named scene materials:

```text
[materials]
material gold {
type=metal
preset=gold
roughness=0.15
}

[meshes]
mesh statue_mesh {
file=objects/statue.obj
}

[scene]
object statue {
mesh=statue_mesh
position=(0,0,0)
material=gold
}
```

## Blender Exporter

Blender scenes can be exported through Blender's Python API:

```sh
"/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender" -b scene.blend --python tools/blender_export_luz.py -- --output exports/scene.luz
./luz --file exports/scene.luz --threads 8
```

The exporter writes a `.luz` file plus OBJ meshes. Usage and current fidelity
limits are documented in [`docs/blender-exporter.md`](docs/blender-exporter.md).

## Personal Note

Special thanks to the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) book series. It was a great source of inspiration and information during a big part of the development of Luz, specially since those were times before AI.
